# Public-vs-Private-Indian-College-Analysis-Top-200

I have Analyized the top 200 Universities of India based on Private and Public sectors. The dataset was taken from Kaggle. The analysis was done with Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Link to the Dataset:- /kaggle/input/top-engineering-colleges-india/200_top_Engineering_Colleges_india.csv 

- I started off with finding the total number of Private and Public Universities.
  - Public universities:- 90 || Private Universities:- 110

- Then I analysized the Public and Private Universities based on thier grades.
  - There were 5 types of grades:- A, AA, AAA, AAAA, AAAAA (A: Lowest - AAAAA: Highest)

- Public Universities Analysis based on Grade
  - AAAAA:- 26 Universities
  - AAAA:- 48 Universities
  - AAA:- 9 Universities
  - AA:- 1 Universites 
  - A:- 0 Universities 
  
- Most of the public universities were with grades AAAA and 26 public universites were given the grade AAAAA.

- I did a similar analysis for the private universites and found out the following:- 
  - AAAAA:- 7 Universities
  - AAAA:- 71 Universities
  - AAA:- 19 Universities
  - AA:- 0 Universites 
  - A:- 0 Universities 
  
- 71 private universities are given the grade AAAAA but only 7 were with the AAAAA grade.

- After my analysis of the top 10 univeristes I found out the all the top 10 Univerisities are from the public sector and none from the private sector.

- While I was analyzing the the Universities based on their total score I found out that the following universities have not been ranked by the NIRF:-
  - PESCE Mandya - PES College of Engineering (Rank: 137)
  - Mahindra University, Hyderabad (Rank: 154)
  - Rabindranath Tagore University, Raisen (Rank: 167)
  - RGIPT Amethi - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology (Rank: 182)
  
- Initially I was trying to get the number of universities which have a score above 80 but only the top 4 universities had a score above 80 and all of them were Public Universities, therefore I lowered my score threshold to 50. 
  - Analysis after reducing the threshold:-
